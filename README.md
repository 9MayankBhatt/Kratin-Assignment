# Kratin-Assignment

My name is Mayank Bhatt; I am from Raipur, Chhattisgarh. For my graduation, I have done my Engineering from ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING branch. After graduation, I worked as a Junior Engineer and after that I also worked as a System Adminitrator and then in order to learn the core technology and make myself technically strong and to build good coding skills I opted for PG-DAC course.

## Description 
I've created a web application using Spring boot, ReactJS and MySQL to help and provide health checkup assistance to elderly people(above 65 years old).

The primary objective of web application is to simplify the process of health checkup who may face challenges and require assistance in managing their health.
The web application offers a comprehensive range of features to facilitate health monitoring after creating personalized profile that includes their basic informations and existing conditions like blood pressure, cholesterol level, heart rate, height, weight. 
Based on these informations a user is placed on categories of doctors(n this porject we have 6 different categoories).
for example;
if a user has Blood pressure below or high from normal range then that user is placed on Cardiologist category as that user should meet a cardiologist for further checkups and to gain further help.

The core functionality of the application revolves around scheduling/booking an appointment with the doctors which through a mail generated and sent on users id through backend which includes all the details regarding the appointment. With the help of this functionality and also based on the details filled before, user can view their upcoming appointments for specific tests with doctors having specialist in that particular field. 

In this way I tried to make a user-friendly application to help users and to contribute in their overall well being.
